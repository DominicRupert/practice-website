          <h1>Bio</h1>
          <p class="card">
            I was born in California, but I swear I'm not one of "those"
            Californians. I drive well and am very polite. I moved to Idaho to
            be closer to my friends I met online 5 years ago. For the longest
            time I wanted to make a career out of my love for computers, but I
            could just never get the drive to push myself into the field until
            now. I told myself that manual labor jobs, while typically having
            decent pay, is just not fufilling for me. I need mental stimulation,
            and if the last couple days have been any indication, then I have
            found the right career path for just that. I enjoy gaming, Listening
            to music, riding my bike, and going to the gym when it's not packed.
            I am very reliable, with an excellent work ethic.
